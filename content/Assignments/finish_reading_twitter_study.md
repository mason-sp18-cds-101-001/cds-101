Write an introduction about yourself in the `#3-members` channel on [Slack][cds101-slack].

Finish reading the editorial and skimming the white paper from the [Can Twitter predict election results?][twitter-election-activity] activity we started during class on January 23rd.
Then, post your answer to question 1 in the `#5-discussion` channel on [Slack][cds101-slack], using the hashtag `#class01` somewhere in your message.
