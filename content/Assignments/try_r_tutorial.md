[Instructions]{.h3}

Complete all the levels of the [Try R tutorial on codeschool.com][try-r-tutorial-link] before class begins on Tuesday, January 30th.
After you complete the interactive tutorial, you will receive a certificate of completion.

It is recommended that you sign up for an account before starting, as this will let you save your progress.

[Submission]{.h3}

Take a desktop screenshot of the certificate (Print Screen button) and send it to Dr. Glasbrenner as a [Slack Direct Message][cds101-slack].
The screenshot should show some sort of identifiable information.
For example, open a small notepad window and type your name there, like this:

[![](/img/screenshot_example_of_identification.png){width=100%}][screenshot-full-image]
